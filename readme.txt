Meta Box plugin is a powerful, professional developer toolkit to create custom meta boxes and custom fields for your custom post types in WordPress.

== Description ==

**Meta Box is a powerful, professional, and lightweight toolkit for developers to create custom meta boxes and custom fields for any custom post type in WordPress.**

Meta Box helps you add [https://metabox.io/what-is-custom-fields-in-wordpress/](https://metabox.io) and details on your website such as pages, posts, custom post types, forms and anywhere you want using over 40 different field types such as text, images, file upload, checkboxes, and more.

On top of that, each WordPress custom field type has extensive internal options for unlimited content possibilities. Complete customization and control is just a few clicks away.

Adding WordPress custom fields and custom meta boxes for custom post types is quick and painless: Select the field types you want in the user-friendly [Online Generator](https://metabox.io/online-generator/), then copy and paste the code into your child theme's `functions.php` file.

**Boom! All the power with none of the bloat.**

There are also free and premium extensions available to add enhanced capabilities. You can manage the display and organization of your WordPress custom fields, the conditions upon which they appear, and become the ultimate WordPress data wizard.

You can also check out the [full list of extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) and [MetaBox.io](https://metabox.io) for details.

### Features

#### Create any type of metadata or custom fields in WordPress

That's right – any type. No matter where you need to insert custom data and features, Meta Box's WordPress custom fields have your back, and with infinite options to boot.

**Here are just a few of the data types you can customize:**

- Posts
- Pages
- Custom post types (you can also use our free plugin [MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies](https://metabox.io/plugins/custom-post-type/) to create custom post types and custom taxonomies)
- [Taxonomies](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-term-meta/)
- [Settings pages or Customizer sections](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-settings-page/)
- [User profile pages](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-user-profile/)
- [Post comments](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-comment-meta/)
- [And even more data types](https://docs.metabox.io/field-settings/) than Batman has tools on his utility belt.

#### A wide-range of field types and options

Take your standard WordPress custom field and imagine it infinitely expanded. That's how many options Meta Box gives you:

- Meta Box supports [40+ built-in WordPress custom field types](https://docs.metabox.io/field-settings/) for all your needs including text, textarea, WYSIWYG editor, image, file, post, select, checkbox, radio buttons, date/time picker, taxonomy, user, oembed and more to come.
- Not enough? You can also [effortlessly create your own field type](https://docs.metabox.io/custom-field-type/).
- Meta Box supports cloning fields for most field types including the WYSIWYG editor field. It also supports [repeatable field groups](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-group/).

#### It's developer-friendly

As a developer, you have enough on your plate. You shouldn't have to create an entirely new system for each project. Use Meta Box to your full advantage.

You can use Meta Box and its custom fields for any custom post type in WordPress on as many websites as you want so you can use it on client projects as well.
