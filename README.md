# Meta Box - A Framework for Dynamic WordPress Websites

[Meta Box](https://metabox.io) is a professional framework that makes building and customizing a website with dynamic data and content in WordPress fun and easy.

Meta Box helps you add [custom fields](https://metabox.io/series/custom-fields/) and dynamic data to posts, pages, custom post types, forms and anywhere you want using over 40+ different field types such as text, images, file upload, checkboxes, and more.

On top of that, each WordPress custom field type has extensive internal options for unlimited content possibilities. Complete customization and control is just a few clicks away.

> **Meta Box Lite**<br>
> We recommend using [Meta Box Lite](https://metabox.io/lite/), a feature-rich free UI version of Meta Box that provides UI and all free features for managing custom fields and dynamic content on WordPress, including post types, taxonomies, custom fields, and relationships.

## Meta Box Features

### Create any type of custom fields in WordPress

That's right â€“ any type. No matter where you need to insert custom data and features, Meta Box's WordPress custom fields have your back, and with infinite options to boot.

**Here are just a few of the data types you can customize:**

- Posts
- Pages
- Custom post types (you can also use our free plugin [MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies](https://metabox.io/plugins/custom-post-type/) to create custom post types and custom taxonomies)
- [Taxonomies](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-term-meta/)
- [Settings pages or Customizer sections](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-settings-page/)
- [User profile pages](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-user-profile/)
- [Post comments](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-comment-meta/)

### A wide-range of field types and options

Take your standard WordPress custom field and imagine it infinitely expanded. That's how many options Meta Box gives you:

- Meta Box supports [40+ built-in WordPress custom field types](https://docs.metabox.io/fields/) for all your needs including text, textarea, WYSIWYG editor, image, file, post, select, checkbox, radio buttons, date/time picker, taxonomy, user, oembed and more to come.
- Not enough? You can also [effortlessly create your own field type](https://docs.metabox.io/custom-field-type/).
- Meta Box supports cloning fields for most field types including the WYSIWYG editor field. It also supports [repeatable field groups](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-group/).

### It's developer-friendly

As a developer, you have enough on your plate. You shouldn't have to create an entirely new system for each project. Use Meta Box to your full advantage.

You can use Meta Box and its custom fields for any custom post type in WordPress on as many websites as you want so you can use it on client projects as well.

- Has an ultra-lightweight, yet powerful API that won't overload your site.
- Add only what you need instead of getting stuck with a bundle of features you don't even want that bloat your site.
- Meta Box [easily integrates with any theme and plugin](https://docs.metabox.io/integration/), and supports Composer!

- Has a lot of [actions](https://docs.metabox.io/category/actions/) and [filters](https://docs.metabox.io/category/filters/) so you can build or change a site's appearance and behavior in the plugin.
